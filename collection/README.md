# Nextbike Data Aggregation Setup

Install the Nextbike data collection on a server using Containers.

Continuously collect and store data from the Nextbike API, every minute, ready for analysis.

Uses Postgres as a database, and a Python3 script to pull the data.

## Install

```SHELL
# Clone rpeo
git clone https://github.com/zwoefler/nextbike-city-analysis.git
cd nextbike-city-analysis/data_collection

# Copy the fake env vars
cp .env.example .env

# Pulls & builds the images and starts the aggregation in the background
docker compose --file docker-compose.yaml up -d
```
